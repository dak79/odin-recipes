# Odin Recipes

This project is part of The Odin Project Foundation Course.

It is completely developed in HTML and the aim of Odin Recipes is to explore
the potentiality of that markup language.

The site is fairly simple: one homepage, three recipes pages. No CSS and no
JavaScript are involved: as style, i had only to set the images' width.

As content, you can find 3 nice Italian recipes. Enjoy if you will decide
to give them a try!
