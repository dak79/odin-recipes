# Odin Recipes

This project is part of The Odin Project Foundation Course.

It is developed in HTML and the aim of Odin Recipes is to explore
the potentiality of that markup language.

The site is fairly simple: one homepage, three recipes pages.

CSS is added as an activity requested from course.
No JavaScript is involved.

As content, you can find 3 nice Italian recipes. Enjoy if you will decide
to give them a try!
