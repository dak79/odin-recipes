## Description
This project is part of [The Odin Project Foundation Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes).
The design is fairly simple multipage website: one homepage, three recipes pages.
As content, you can find 3 nice Italian recipes. Enjoy if you will decide
to give them a try!

## Tecnologies
* HTML
* CSS
* Git
* GitHub Pages

This web site is developed in HTML and the aim of Odin Recipes is to explore
the potentiality of that markup language.
CSS is added as an activity requested from course.
No JavaScript is involved.

## Assignement
* Initial Structure
Within the odin-recipes directory, create an index.html file, fill it out with the usual boilerplate HTML and add an h1 heading “Odin Recipes” to the body.

* Recipe Page
Create a new directory within the odin-recipes directory and name it recipes.
Create a new HTML file within the recipes directory and name it after the recipe it will contain. 
For now, just include an h1 heading with the recipe’s name as its content.
Back in the index.html file, add a link to the recipe page you just created. 

* Recipe Page Content
Your new recipe page should have the following content:
An image of the finished dish under the h1 heading that you added earlier.
Under the image, it should have an appropriately sized “Description” heading followed by a paragraph or two describing the recipe.
Under the description, add an “Ingredients” heading followed by an unordered list of the ingredients needed for the recipe.
Finally, under the ingredients list, add a “Steps” heading followed by an ordered list of the steps needed for making the dish.

* Add More Recipes
Add two more recipes with identical page structures to the recipe page you’ve already created.
Don’t forget to link to the new recipes on the index page. Also, consider putting all the links in an unordered list so they aren’t all on one line.
