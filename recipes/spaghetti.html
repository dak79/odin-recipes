            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                A symbolic dish of Italian cuisine, with the typical
                ingredients of the Bel Paese: spaghetti, tomato and basil.
                <strong>Spaghetti with tomato sauce</strong> is an institution,
                a simple but far from rivial recipe. It is subject to infinite
                variations to find the perfect balance of flavors, the right
                creaminess and sweetness, starting from the choice of the type
                of tomato. This classic first course is a real test for those
                who love to prepare it at home, but also for star chefs who
                jealously guard the secrets of their perfect versions! Here we
                are at the stove with you to suggest our recipe of this
                timeless classic: peeled tomatoes cooking slowly over low heat
                and the scent of fresh basil leaves are the key ingredients to
                successful results! You may remember the famous scene from the
                movie <em>"Miseria e Nobilt√†"</em>, when Felice Sciosciammocca
                and the other members of the family swoop down on the serving
                plate and start grabbing spaghetti with tomato sauce with their
                hands... well, we are sure that with our version you will be

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li class="step">
                    To make spaghetti with tomato sauce, start by preparing the
                    sauce. Pour the extra virgin olive oil in a pan with the peeled
                    and halved garlic clove, so you can remove the core and make
                    the scent more delicate.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Cook for 2 minutes over high heat, add the peeled tomatoes and
                    salt.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Cover with a lid and cook for at least 1 hour over very low
                    heat: the sauce should simmer gently.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Mix it from time to time. After this time, remove the garlic
                    and pass the tomatoes through a sieve to obtain a smooth and
                    homogeneous puree.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Pour the sauce back into the pan, turn the heat to very low and
                    add the basil leaves.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    After a few minutes, turn off the sauce and keep it warm. All
                    you have to do now is cook the pasta in plenty of boiling
                    salted water.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Drain the spaghetti al dente directly into the sauce and stir
                    for a few moments over high heat to mix everything together.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Your spaghetti with tomato sauce is ready, all you have to do
                    is serve it, garnished with fresh basil to taste!
