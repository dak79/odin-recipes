        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            A symbolic dish of Italian cuisine, with the typical ingredients of
            the Bel Paese: spaghetti, tomato and basil. <strong>Spaghetti with
            tomato sauce</strong> is an institution, a simple but far from
            trivial recipe. It is subject to infinite variations to find the
            perfect balance of flavors, the right creaminess and sweetness,
            starting from the choice of the type of tomato. This classic first
            course is a real test for those who love to prepare it at home, but
            also for star chefs who jealously guard the secrets of their
            perfect versions! Here we are at the stove with you to suggest our
            recipe of this timeless classic: peeled tomatoes cooking slowly
            over low heat and the scent of fresh basil leaves are the key
            ingredients to successful results! You may remember the famous
            scene from the movie <em>"Miseria e Nobilt√†"</em>, when Felice
            Sciosciammocca and the other members of the family swoop down on
            the serving plate and start grabbing spaghetti with tomato sauce
            with their hands... well, we are sure that with our version you
            will be tempted to do the same!
            Enjoy your meal!

        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                To make spaghetti with tomato sauce, start by preparing the
                sauce. Pour the extra virgin olive oil in a pan with the peeled
                and halved garlic clove, so you can remove the core and make
                the scent more delicate.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook for 2 minutes over high heat, add the peeled tomatoes and
                salt.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cover with a lid and cook for at least 1 hour over very low
                heat: the sauce should simmer gently.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix it from time to time. After this time, remove the garlic
                and pass the tomatoes through a sieve to obtain a smooth and
                homogeneous puree.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour the sauce back into the pan, turn the heat to very low and
                add the basil leaves.
            </li>
            <li>
                After a few minutes, turn off the sauce and keep it warm. All
                you have to do now is cook the pasta in plenty of boiling
                salted water.
            </li>
            <li>
                Drain the spaghetti al dente directly into the sauce and stir
                for a few moments over high heat to mix everything together.
            </li>
            <li>
                Your spaghetti with tomato sauce is ready, all you have to do
                is serve it, garnished with fresh basil to taste!
            </li>
        </ol>
