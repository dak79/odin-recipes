        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            The orangey sweetness of pumpkin is one of the most hotly
            anticipated pleasures of fall. This versatile ingredient, featured
            in a whole host of sweet and savory recipes, keeps us company
            through the cold winter months, bringing a touch of color to our
            dishes and warming our hearts at the same time. While pumpkin
            risotto may be one of the best-loved classics of Italian cuisine,
            this <strong>pumpkin and Gorgonzola risotto</strong> is every bit
            as worthy of a place in the Italian culinary tradition. The rich,
            creamy, melting flavor of Gorgonzola, a soft blue cheese typical of
            northern Italy, envelopes the pumpkin in an irresistible embrace,
            leaving the rice, artfully toasted, softened, and creamed as the
            risotto tradition dictates, to do the rest. The result? A creamy,
            tasty first course that’s great for family dinners and special
            occasions alike and is sure to win everyone over at the first bite,
            delighting the palate with a whole host of flavors that really
            showcase the true magic of fall... and of good food!

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                To cook the pumpkin and Gorgonzola risotto, start by preparing
                the vegetable broth for cooking the rice, and wash, peel, and
                cut the vegetables into chunks.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place them in a pot, along with the water, parsley, and salt.
                Cover with a lid, bring to a boil, and cook for around 1 hour.
                When the broth is ready, strain it through a sieve and keep it
                warm.
            </li>
            <li>
                Next, turn your attention to the pumpkin, removing the skin,
                seeds, and pulp inside, cutting it into thin slices, and then
                dicing it.
            </li>
            <li>
                Finely chop the onion.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat the oil in a large saucepan, add the onion, and brown on
                very low heat for around 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the onion is soft and transparent, add the diced pumpkin.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir well and simmer with the hot broth. Cook the pumpkin,
                stirring frequently and adding more broth as needed. This will
                take around 20 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the meantime, toast the rice separately (the moisture
                created by the pumpkin in the pan would prevent the grains from
                sealing properly): heat a large frying pan on high heat and
                pour in the unwashed rice.
            </li>
            <li>
                Toast the rice for a few minutes, stirring frequently so that
                it doesn't burn, then simmer with the white wine and stir
                immediately so that it doesn't stick.
            </li>
            <li>
                Next, transfer it to the pan containing the pumpkin and cook
                for a couple of minutes, stirring continuously.
            </li>
            <li>
                Start adding the broth, a ladle at a time, adding the next only
                once the previous one has been absorbed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Continue doing this, stirring frequently, until the rice is
                cooked according to the time stated on the packaging.
            </li>
            <li>
                When the rice is nearly cooked, season with salt and pepper to
                taste. Turn off the heat and cream the risotto with the butter.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the Gorgonzola and mix thoroughly (you can add a little
                more broth at this stage if youwant to achieve a creamier
                risotto, known as "all’onda").
            </li>
            <li>
                You can also put the lid back on the pan for a few moments to
                help the cheese to melt.
            </li>
            <li>
                Plate up, and garnish with a few pieces of fresh rosemary. Your
                pumpkin and Gorgonzola risotto is ready to be served!
            </li>
