            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Just say its name and there's a standing ovation at the table. It's
                the queen of single courses, the consolation for hurt feelings:
                <strong>eggplant parmigiana</strong>. A recipe shared and disputed
                as to origins from north to south: Emilia Romagna, Campania
                (Parmigiana is mulignane) and Sicily (Parmiciana or Patrociane)
                with some variations in ingredients and ways to compose it, but all
                absolutely fabulous! Do you ever wonder why it's called that? The
                name <em>"Parmigiana"</em> comes from the Sicilian
                <em>"Parmiciana"</em>, which in dialect means the stacked wood
                slats in blinds: think about how the slices of eggplant are
                arranged in the pan and you will see the similarities. Few
                ingredients, lots of flavor for a dish that is a symbol of
                Mediterranean cuisine: tomato, eggplant, basil and cheese... a mix
                that also goes perfectly with pasta as in the recipe for lumaconi
                alla parmigiana (snails parmigiana). But now make a succulent
                eggplant parmigiana with us!

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li class="step">
                    To prepare the eggplant parmigiana, start by washing and drying
                    the eggplant. Then with a knife remove the stem and slice the
                    eggplant lengthwise with a vegetable slicer, or alternatively
                    with a knife, to obtain slices about 1/8' (4-5 mm) thick.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    As you place the slices inside a colander, sprinkle them with a
                    very small amount of coarse salt between the layers, well
                    distributed (you can also use a little fine salt); continue
                    this way until you finish it all.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    On top of the eggplants, place a plate with a weight on it to
                    let the eggplants purge the excess water and slightly bitter
                    taste, the enemy of fried food.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Leave it like this for at least 1 hour. Remember to rinse the
                    slices well under running water, one by one if necessary, to
                    remove the salt and pat them dry before use.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    In the meantime, slice and cut the fiordilatte cheese into
                    strips, after which you will have very small cubes. If you
                    don't have another colander, you can place them on a very clean
                    cloth.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    In the meantime, make the sauce. In a large saucepan pour a
                    drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and add the chopped onion,
                    stir often so as not to burn it and let it brown for a couple
                    of minutes.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Then add the tomato puree and a little water, the salt and let
                    it simmer for 45 minutes. When finished cooking do not forget
                    to add the basil leaves by hand.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Heat plenty of vegetable oil and in the meantime rinse the
                    portion of eggplant that you are going to fry and dry it with
                    oil blotting paper: always proceed a little at a time so they
                    do not darken 11.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Fry a few slices at a time 12 in boiling oil at 340째 F (170째
                    C).
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    After cooking 2-3 minutes, drain on absorbent paper; do the
                    same with all the others. At this point you should have
                    everything you need, so move on to putting it together.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Cover the bottom of an 8 x 12" (20x30cm) baking dish with a
                    little sauce, then make the first layer by arranging the
                    eggplant slices horizontally.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Grate some black pepper, sprinkle with parmesan cheese and pour
                    some cubes of fiordilatte cheese, distributing them evenly. And
                    finally pour on a little more sauce, just enough to color the
                    inside.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Repeat the same procedure this time by arranging the eggplant
                    slices on top; continue this way to make the layers by
                    inverting the direction of the slices each time.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Between layers, remember to press gently with the palms of your
                    hands in order to compact them. On the last layer pour the
                    remaining tomato puree, the cubes of fiordilatte and parmesan
                    cheese.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Now it's time to bake your eggplant parmigiana in a hot oven at
                    400째 F (200째 C) for 40 minutes.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Once ready, let it cool a few minutes before serving.
                </li>
            </ol>
